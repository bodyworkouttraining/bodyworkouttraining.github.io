<p>DO get pre-workout massage if it is short approx. Your muscles need to. A post-workout massage will help relax and make the muscles more flexible. Light exercise such as moderate walking gentle stretching or easy-paced swimming are okay for most healthy individuals after their massage. DO get a pre-workout massage if you want to reduce your anxiety or stress level before an event.</p>

<p>Sustained pressure on connective tissue during massages makes the tissue more gel-like. Strenuous exercise includes running weight lifting high-intensity aerobics power yoga and more. A deep tissue massage for instance might feel good in the moment but itll leave your muscles too raw and sore before a workout which may increase the risk of muscle strain or injury. Light exercise such as walking or gentle swimming is fine after a massage. A little bit of delayed onset muscle soreness or DOMS is a completely normal after effect of massage.</p>
