<p>This is very similar to my 460m turnaround indoor workout for speed endurance though I prefer a full recovery of 15-20 minutes between sets again this is just me. The training sessions that coaches refer to as Special Endurance 2 work are an important part of every 12 day middle distance microcycle. No jogging for rest. Gradually slow down to. An example of a Speed Endurance workout would be 3 x 80m 100m 120m with full recovery.</p>

<p>1 mile in and outs 100M sprint. Steady state or fluctuating intensity. Sprinters Speed Endurance Workouts Dont start Until Week 3 or 4 Speed Endurance Day 1 8 x 7040s Sprint 70m 8-10 sec 20 sec rest Sprint 40 6 sec 3 min rest Speed Endurance Day 2 5 to 8 13070s Sprint 130 15 20 40 sec rest Sprint 70 4 min rest Speed Endurance Day 3. On the other hand the only way to improve speed endurance is by training at a high intensity for an extended amount of time. The speedspecial endurance workout that myself and my main man Joe did on September 19th is a classic track workout for sprinters.</p>
