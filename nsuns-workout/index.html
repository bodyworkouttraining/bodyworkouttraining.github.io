<p>Did Stronglifts for 3 months then switched to Wendlers 531 for a while then started nSuns as I was looking to up my overall volume. The routine was developed and popularized by a user on reddits rfitness forum. Key principles carried over from 531 include hitting the main lift of the day for a set of 5 reps a set of 3 reps and then a set of 1 rep as well as the notion of using 90 of an athletes 1RM as a TM or training max and calculating all main lifts as a of the TM. The workout sessions lasted me anywhere from 1hr 30min up to 2hrs on hard leg days with lots of accessories. I do the 4-day routine and superset all my accessories once Ive finished the main 3 work sets for the T1.</p>
