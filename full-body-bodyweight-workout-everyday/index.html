<p>You can do basic bodyweight workouts every day depending upon the intensity. Gina Su says I rarely ever comment but I thought this video was great. Instead of lifting weights daily the NSCA guidelines state that beginners should aim for two to three days each week of resistance training workouts that involve all of the major muscle groups. The idea is to stay healthy and injury free. Subscribe to the channel so you never miss a workout from me.</p>

<p>You have to do body weight exercises every day when you are young. I prefer to add in some periodization utilizing the following block structure-Blue - muscular endurance-based training -Green - strength endurance -Orange -. Make your bodyweight workouts more demanding by resting just 20-30 seconds between sets. Start your weight loss journey with Noom Weight. Each movement pushups sit-ups and air squats in this workout helps exercise your entire body.</p>
