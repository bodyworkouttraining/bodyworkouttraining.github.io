<p>Pre and post workout snacks were the toughest to plan for during my first Whole30. Its early in your program and youre still trying to figure out how big to make your meals. Personally I dont like eating before a morning workout but if I know it will be awhile before breakfast I might do half a banana or apple slices with some almond butter. The Whole30 meal template says to have an easily digestible small serving of protein and fat 15 to 75 minutes before your workout and this checks the boxes. Instead you should choose pre-workout snacks that will help nourish your body and push you through the toughest workouts.</p>
