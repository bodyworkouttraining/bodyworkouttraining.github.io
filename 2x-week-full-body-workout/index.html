<p>The only reason you see whole body three days a week being touted is because those programs are based around the big threefour barbell lifts and those three days arent all the same. This allows you to hit all the major muscle groups twice per. This is a 2-day full body routine which obviously uses the 2-day version of the split thats designed for pretty much anyone who is only able to.

<p>The goal for beginners is to gain muscle mass which is why 3 of the 6 days in the gym are heavy. Your idea is stupid. Full body workout 2x a week instead of 3x a week. Standing Calf Raises. 3 sets x 510 reps Front Squat.</p>
