<p>I dont know about you but I have to play psychological tricks on myself from time to time to get things done. During the next five weeks Shaun T will lead you through seven brand new workouts. Focus T25 has been amazing so far and I cant wait to see my results tomorrow. With T25 the work is quicker but the calorie intake is lower. Anyway Im in my last week of Alpha.</p>

<p>Dynamic Core cardio focus on strengthening your abs while maintaining balance. I did the first Double Day Friday in Alpha but found out that I sucked at the second workout that is Lower Focus because of doing it right after the first one. All I can say is wow. If you have the CORE SPEED workout in your DVD wallet you can use it in place of SPEED 20 anywhere it appears on the calendar. The exercise moves change every 30.</p>
