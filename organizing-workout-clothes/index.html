I like using a hanging shoe organizer for an exercise gear station because it doesnt take up a lot of space its easy to get to and it helps me keep my outfits together. I definitely have a major problem especially now I have all my wonderful Saucony stuff and feel incredibly loyal to them steve thinks a little too loyal yet I cant bring myself to throw out all the years of the evil brand so they just stuff up my drawer.</p>
