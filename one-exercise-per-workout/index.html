<p>The single set system is a good workout method for exercise enthusiasts new to the workout scene. Prior to that I had done two sets per exercise. If you start off with 1 setexerciseworkout and add 1 set each time you perform that workout youll quickly find a dropoff point - typically between 4 and 6 sets per exercise. But if youre training a muscle group only once a week youre probably going to end up doing 2 or 3 exercises for each muscle group. Each week perform two upper-body workouts and two lower-body workouts with two exercises per large muscle group and one exercise per smaller muscle groups.</p>

Vigorous aerobic exercise includes activities such as running heavy yard work and aerobic dancing.</p>
