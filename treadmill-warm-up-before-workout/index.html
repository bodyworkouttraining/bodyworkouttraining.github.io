<p>Ready for an awesome warm up. I often start with a 12 minute warm-up before my workout. Before each session I would advise doing some glute activation exercises and making sure you loosen your hip flexors says Scarrott. To loosen up your muscles and get your heart pumping walk on the treadmill at a steady pace somewhere between 2-3. Its important to warm up your body before interval training on a treadmill.</p>

<p>Now do 20 seconds at your maximum speed. Now if only men would follow suit. Before each session I would advise doing some glute activation exercises and making sure you loosen your hip flexors says Scarrott. Before a speed workout a combination of dynamic stretches and easy running ensures the muscles are receiving adequate amounts of oxygen-rich blood. The speed should be moderate enough that you can talk while you do it.</p>

<p>Never ever begin a speed workout without a warm-up. Its fun fast and gets the job done. The more intense your workout is going to be the longer your warmup should be. The speed should be moderate enough that you can talk while you do it. You should always have a 5-15 minute warm-up before any workout.</p>
