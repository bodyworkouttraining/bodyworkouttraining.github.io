Once or maybe twice a week is good but make sure you allow at least 5 or 6 six days in between bicep workouts if youre training them twice a week. I personally work my biceps twice a week and my triceps once however when I work my triceps on the one day I do them I do two exercises with three sets of six repetitions each for a total of 36 repetitions a week. Currently my bicep size is 15 inches back in previous year it was 11 inches so how was I able to achieve this sizelets talk about this.</p>

<p>This guide on how many times you should workout your chest will help you make the best of your training time with simple suggestions based on what you want out of the gym. If you can go for another couple weeks as each additional workout will only add to your arm circumference. Generally speaking working out your arms anywhere from two to six times per week is fine but it absolutely depends on your fitness level and your exercise regimen. You should work out your biceps two to three times a week following a strength-training schedule and gradually working your way up to a greater number of sets and repetitions. I work my biceps on one exercise the barbell curl as part of two weekly workouts with three sets of six repetitions in each workout.</p>

<p>Because they are a small muscle they generally need more time to recover from a workout. I also suggest that the week after week six you take it fairly easy on your arms and train them just once that week before getting back into any serious training programs. To start you might only want to do two or three days per week and slowly work your way up to five days. In general you should do approximately 2 exercises per muscle group and train each muscle group two times a week. If you train arms 6 days per week youll do one exercise per muscle group per day with only 2.</p>

<p>Try just working each muscle group one time per week. This research shows that you can get results from training arms and biceps just once a week though this may not be optimal. Their findings showed that there was plenty of evidence that suggested training more than 1x per week was more beneficial to maximize muscle growth. How frequently you work your biceps depends on your individual fitness goals. Remember it takes time to see super-sized guns and the bis are only one half of the equation your triceps make up the other half.</p>
