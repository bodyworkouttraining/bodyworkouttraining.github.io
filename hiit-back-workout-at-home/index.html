<p>I also learned to substitute my favorite bad foods with healthier alternatives. Perform ten 30-yard sprints alternating going back to start with backwards running and side shuffles. Sprint 10 yards walk back to start then sprint 20 yards and walk back to start. Or you can come back and check for the next workout. Instead of requiring equipment HIIT workouts focus entirely on bodyweight exercises.</p>
