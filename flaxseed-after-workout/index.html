<p>Baking is probably the most common way to incorporate flaxseed into your diet. Resist the urge to stuff your face after a workout and try chia seeds instead. Weight change and Flax seed oil tablets. As an extremely versatile oil organic flaxseed oil can be incorporated into many recipes. Also reduces the recovery time after the workout sessions and boosts the natural production of testosterone in the body.</p>

<p>You can easily add ground flaxseed into muffins bread cookies or cakes. I wasnt able to find a study that compared body response to protein source post workout specifically. To summarize if you eat the flax seed you may not get as much protein as you would from a meat source but it may have other benefits that the meat wouldnt especially if you already do consume animal proteins at other time. Is it a good idea to throw some flaxseed into my oatmeal at breakfast or should I avoid fats pre-workout. You definitely want to limit the amount of fiber you take in 2 hours before and after exercising.</p>
