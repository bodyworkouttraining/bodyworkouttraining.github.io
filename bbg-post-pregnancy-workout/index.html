<p>Prior to pregnancy I was working out three to four times a week high-intensity training. Before you begin make sure to warm up using dynamic stretches or a few minutes of cardio such as walking to activate the muscles youre about to use. Getting back into working out after having a baby can be a challenge especially if youre not sure where to begin. This exciting new venture has been a long time coming for the Bikini Body Guides BBG creator who spoke with Shape exclusively about why she decided to launch the program now seven months after giving birth to her first child daughter Arna. I highly recommend BBG after pregnancy but given the intensity of the workouts make sure you are ready.</p>
