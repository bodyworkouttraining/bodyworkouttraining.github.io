<p>I am so thankful that Beachbody has come out with a pre-workout that is as natural and safe as any I have found. But pay attention to your babys reaction and pay attention to how your feeling. I avoid all preworkouts and supplements when breastfeeding. Lactic acid nutritional profile tasting. Branched chain amino acids BCAA 4.</p>

<p>The best pre-workout for you is going to be a personalized choice. Hi mommies does anyone know if its ok for me to take a preworkout while breast feeding. It is a natural product but of course has stimulants no caffeine. Also I would avoid all supplements unless your pediatrician gives the okay. Talk to your healthcare provider before starting any kind of supplement regime.</p>
