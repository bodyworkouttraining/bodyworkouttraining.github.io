<p>The argument for taking creatine before a workout is usually based on this thought process. And theres nothing wrong with this approach as long as you look at the label. Because the most important thing seems to be taking Creatine consistently although most studies show that its best to take it close to your workout either shortly before or after you may be wondering what the benefit is of including Creatine in pre-workout specifically.
