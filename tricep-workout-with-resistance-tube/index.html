<p>Put the resistance band on the floor in front of you in a straight line from right to leftJump over the band with both feet to land in front then jump diagonally back moving to the right. There are also several different styles of band. Im always looking for the most effective tricep exercise. Ive arranged the exercises according to which part of the body they focus. Please keep the suggestions coming.</p>
