<p>Bench press is one of the most talked about and effective measures of building up strength and hence is tagged as the most recommended exercise for baseball players. Lift the weight bar and get it straight down to the middle of your chest area and then back up to full extension without locking your elbows. The first thing we are going to do is walking lunges.

The first thing we are going to do is walking lunges. Every year players are becoming stronger and faster.</p>
