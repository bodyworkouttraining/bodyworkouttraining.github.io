<p>Obviously if I was on a bench my elbows would end up lower than the rest of my body which I assume is part of the reasoning behind the exercise. Without a bench and performing it on the ground my elbows will only lower to floor level. Focus on getting tension in the chest NOT the shoulder joints. For most trained men pushups are like doing a warmup set of benches. Instead of traditional bench press youre going to focus more on incline chest exercises.</p>
