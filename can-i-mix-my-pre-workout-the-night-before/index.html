I work outteach multiple times a day so I have to change two to three times throughout my day. In the interest of streamlining said process Ive found ways around washing my hair after hitting the gym in the AM. The last thing i want to deal with at 4am is trying to get all my supps together and mixingshaking stuff.</p>

<p>The main ingredient in most pre-workout products is caffeine. It takes your body 3-5 hours to cut the concentration of caffeine in your blood in half. Finally lets talk about timing. Fat can also be beneficial but it should be consumed at least two hours before exercise. Theres a reason the directions on pre-workout powders tell you to mix it in water.</p>

<p>Eating a small to medium sized meal may provide ample energy for your workout without the bloated feeling that comes with larger meals that can affect performance. I drink half before I workout and the other half after my workout. Most pre-workouts should be taken roughly 30 minutes before getting to your workout. 5 Caffeine has half-life of between 3 and 7 hours meaning after this time half the caffeine can still be in your system. The best foods to eat before exercising depend on the type of workout and a persons goals.</p>

<p>Urine should be very pale yellow in color like lemonade. Most pre-workouts should be taken roughly 30 minutes before getting to your workout. Washing my hair at night. I mix 1 scoop of protein about 12 cup of coconut water about 14 of coffee because its concentrated and a little bit of watermix it all up the night before. Pretty much everyone will have trouble sleeping if they take a caffeine-heavy pre-workout supplement before an evening workout.</p>
